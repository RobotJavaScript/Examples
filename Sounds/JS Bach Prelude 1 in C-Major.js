// Johann Sebastian Bach - Prelude 1 in C-Major.
// First, a list of MIDI note frequencies are pushed onto an array.  
// While an array literal would have taken less vertical space to create the array, 
//   the .push() method is used here to enable you to see the Note, with its frequency.
// Frequencies for MIDI notes (Musical Instrument Digital Interface)
// The following MIDI note numbers are defined in the MIDI standard and matched to the Middle C (note number 60) as C4.
